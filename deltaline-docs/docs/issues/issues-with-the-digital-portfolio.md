Performance is one of the biggest issues. And thus with Next.js, this should address the issue at hand. 

## The Problem with Google Sites

Google Sites tends to be easy, but really really slow. This means that if you are using it something like Deltaline, then it's going to be slow, and may lag out on older devices. By optimizing it with SSR + Next.js, this should reduce the lag massively. The timings are really really different as well. 

- Google Sites Version = ~ 15-30 seconds
- Deltaline (Next.js + TypeScript) = less than 1 second
