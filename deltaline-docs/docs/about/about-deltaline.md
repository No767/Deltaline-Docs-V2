Deltaline is basically the name for my digital portfolio, which is needed in school. I have written this docs out to lay the basic framework that the digital portfolio contains

The digital portfolio (Deltaline) is hosted on Google Sites. Now, it's meant as a static webpage, but when you add tons of hd assets, and tons of iframes and html code; it starts to lag. This is due to Google's Sites inefficient loading speeds. And the litmiations that google sites has doesn't allow me to use the Bootstrap lib, or use .svg or .webp files for faster load times. For more detail, please look at Issues with the Digital Portfolio page here. Google Sites is highly unoptimized, so building with the leading framework for performance (Next.js) is one of the main reasons why.
